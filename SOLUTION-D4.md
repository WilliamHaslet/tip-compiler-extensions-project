### Overview ###

For this deliverable, we impelmented codegen functions for ternary, arrays, of arrays, array element refrence, array length, increment, decrement, 
true, false, and, or, not, negation, for range loops, and for iterator loops. We also modified existing codegen functions to add support for 
greater then or equal to, less than, less then or equal to, and modulo. Next we added a command line option to disable type infrence and wrote 
system tests to validate and get coverage for of codegen functions.
